# MDM Template - Process Branch  
`main` branch for the `<Project Title>` Project by `<Developer/Designer/Artist/Person Name>`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This branch **must** stay separate from the `process` branch until the end of the project.
> <br> End of project is denoted by the closing statement in the `process` branch. 

## Process
To capture design process, MDM samples from two distances: up close in commit Messages and reflective journaling at a distance in this `process` branch.      

For a description of reflective practice, refer to the `README` of the `process` branch.

### Commit Messages 
When you use Git/GitHub, your development is discretized and packed into chunks called commits. 

Committing to git is integral to the _development_ process. Commits also allow developers to leave _commit messages_.

By reflecting on the immediate work done at the time of committing in these commit messages, we dovetail this 'what' (code changes) with the 'why' (commit message), enabling us to capture "reflection in action" (Schon, 1983) or "hot reflection". 

At the end of the project, these commit messages become part of the design corpus for this repo (including the reflective journaling) that then gets a grounded theory analysis to validate the design reasoning of the research-creation project.  

> [!NOTE]
> This is reflection is different from reflective journaling which is intended to capture design thinking and proceess at a distance.
>
> Those live in the `process` branch of the repository.
